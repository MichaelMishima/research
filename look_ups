Why is glass transparent?

Photons pass through glass because they're not absorbed. This is because there is nothing which "absorbs"light in the visual
frequencies. UV photons are absorbed by glass, so glass is not transparent for them. Exactly the same happens w/ XR for which
our pody is nearly transparent whilst a metal plate absorbs it.

Any photon has a certain frequency- which for bisible light is related to the color of light, whilst for lower or higher 
frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum, it is simply a measure of the energy transported by the photon. A materal's

STATISTICS
-variance: Var{x}=E[x^2}-E{E}^2. '
-mean (expectation value, E)L x_bar = <x> = sum(p_i x x_i)
-discrete so sum over function f and multiply by the corresponding probability
  -this probability (p_i) is restricted to the interval [0,1].
-for continuous variable:
  -probability density P(x) s.t. P(x)dx = probability finding x between x and dx
  
- <f(x)> = integral{f(x)P(x)dx}

Planck's Constant:
  -related to the quantization of light and matter
  -energy multiplied by time, or momentum multiplied by distance, or angular momentum(pseudo vector- tensor)
  -expressed in Joule-Seconds (JS , or NMS, or Kg M^2 S^-1)
  -planch-einstein relation connects the particular photon energy E with its associated wave frequency: E = hf
  -conceived as a prop. constant between the min increment of E of a hypothetical charged oscillator in a cavity that contains
   black-body radiation, and the frequecy f, of its associated electromagnetic wave


Ionization energy:

  -Defined as the amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron, the valence electron,
   of an isolated gaseous atom to form a cation.
   
  -Quantitatively expressed in sysbols as:
    X + energy -> X^+ + e^-
      X is any atom or molecule capable of being inonized, 
      X^+ is that atom or molecule w/ an electron removed,
      e^- is the removed electron
      
    this is an endothermic process. generally, the closer the electrons are to the nucleus of the
    atom, the higher the atom's ionization energy
 
 
  In Physics, unit is the amount of energy required to remove a single electron from a single atom or molecule expressed
  in electron volt (eV). 
  
  In Chemistry, unit is the amount of energy it takes for 
 
  



VOLTAGES
- voltage of a battery: 1.5v
- voltage of a car battery: 9v, 6 cylinders

IONIZATION
- ionization potential for Hydrogen: 13.6 eV

PHOTONS
- energy of a green photon?
- mass < 1e-18 eV/c^2 
- spin 1
  -energy of green photon: 2.17 - 2.5 eV, f= 540 THz (540e12 Hz) lambda 495-570 nanometers 
- the gauge boson for EM, and therefore all other quantum numbers of the photon (such as leptop number, baryon number,
  and flavour quantum number) are zero
  
- does not obey the Pauli exclusion principle 
 
- how does light interact with matter?

CELESTIAL COORDINATE SYSTEMS:

- Equatorial:
  - centered at Earth's center, fixed relative to the celestial poles and vernal quinox
  - based on locations of stars reltive to Earth's equation if it were prjected out to an infinite distance
  - normal coordinate system (follows the movement of the sky during the night)


- Ecliptic:
  - the fundamental plane is the plane of Earth's orbit
  - two pricipal variants:
     -geocentric: useful for computing the apparent motions of the Sun, Mood, and other solar system bodies
     -heliocentric: useful for computing the positions of solar bodies as well as defining their orbital elements
 
-galactic: 
  -uses the approximate plane of our galaxy as its fundamental plane. Solar system still the center of the coordinate sys
  -Zero point is defined as the direction towards the galactice center
  -Lattitude resembles the elevation above the galactic plane and galactic longitudde determines direction relative to 
   the center of the galaxy.
   
-SuperGalactic
  -Corresponds to a fundamental plane that contains a higher than average number of local galaxies in the sky as seen from Earth.
  


Azimuth:
  -An angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system.
  -Bector from an observer (origin) to a point of interest is projected normally onto a reference frame
  -Angle between the projected bector and a reference bector on the reference plane is called the azimuth.



Gamma Rays(GR):
  -penetrating electromagnetic radiation of a kind arising from the radioactive decay of atomic neclei
  -defined by their energy, ranging to over 10TeV(1e13 eV)
  -this energy is too large to be a product of radioactive decay
  -GR bursts are are thought to be due to the collapse of stars called hypernovae
  -produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced
  -such electrons produce secondary GR by the following;
    -Bremsstrahlu
    
    
    
Inverse Compton Scattering:
  -charged particals (usually electrons) impart energy. to low-energy photons boosting them to higher energy photons
  -such impacts of photons on relativistic charged particle beams is another possible mechanism of GR production.
